# Virtual World

The Virtual World project is a simulation of a real-world environment using a combination of artificial intelligence and computer graphics. The project aims to create a virtual world where self-driving cars can navigate and interact with other objects.

## Features

- A detailed 3D environment with roads, buildings, trees, and other objects.
- Self-driving cars that can navigate the environment and avoid obstacles.
- AI-driven traffic management system that ensures smooth traffic flow.
- A user interface that allows users to control the simulation and observe the behavior of the cars.
